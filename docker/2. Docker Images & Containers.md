# 1. Docker Images & Containers: The Core Building Blocks

## Images & Containers: What and Why?

**Images**
- Templates/ Blueprints for containers
- Contains code + required tools/ runtimes

**Containers**
- The running "unit of software"
- Multiple containers can be created based on one image

## Building our own Image with a Dockerfile

```docker
# you could build a Docker image from scratch.
# based on this Docker hub image for the first time,
# this image was downloaded and cached locally.
FROM node

# Since we changed that working directory to slash app not just to run, but also copy will execute relative to this working directory.
# Now inside of the container internal file system this relative path now points at /app.
# 
WORKDIR /app

# here a very simple instruction we could execute, is copy.dot.
# You basically specify two paths here.
# The first path is path outside of the container, outside of the image where the files leave that should be copied into the image.
# all the files here in the same folder as the Dockerfile and all the folders there as well, will be copied into an app folder inside of the container. 
COPY . /app
# Host file system, Image/container file system

RUN npm install

# To our machine here which will run this container.
# And then we'll be able to run
EXPOSE 80

# This would be incoreect because this would be executed whenever this image is being built.
# The Image should be the template for the container.
# The Image is not what you run in the end, you run a container based on an image. 
# Therefore with this command, we would try to start the server in the image.
# RUN node server.js

# CMD is a bit differently. 
# If you don't specificy a CMD, the CMD of the base image will be executed. With no base image and no CMD, you'd get an error.
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
