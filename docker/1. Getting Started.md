# What is Docker? And Why?

Docker is a **container** technology: A tool for creating and managing containers

## Container
A standardized unit of software
A package of code **and** dependencies to run that code (e.g. NodeJS code + the NodeJS runtime)

The same container always yields the **exact same application and execution behavior!** No matter where or by whom it might be executed.

Support for Containers **is built into** modern operating systems!

**Docker simplifies** the creation and management of such containers

### Why Containers?
Why would we want **independent, standardized "application packages"**?

- **Defferent Development & Production Envvironments**
  - We want to build and test in exactle (!) the same environment as we later run our app in
- **Defferent Development Environments Within a Team / Company**
  - Every team member should have the exactily (!) same environment when working on the same project
- **Clashing Tools / Versions Between Different Pojects**
  - When switching between projects, tools used in project A should not clash with tools used in project B

### We want Reliability & Reproducible Environments
✔ We want to have the **exact same environment for development and production** ➡ This ensures that it works exactly as tested
✔ It should be easy to **share a common development environment** setup with (new) employees and colleagues

### The Problems
**Environment**: The runtimes, languages, frameworks you need for development
- Development Environment ↔ Production Environment
  - often not the same
- Development Environment for Employee A ↔ Development Environment for Employee B
  - often not the same
- Tools & Libraries required for Project A ↔ Tools & Libraries required for Project B
  - often not the same


# Solution: Virtual Machines / Virtual Operating Systems
Wastes a lot of space on your hard drive and tends to be slow

## Virtual Machines / Virtual OS: Summary

Pro
- Separated environments
- Enviornment-specific configurations are possible
- Enviornment configurations can be chared and reproduced reliably

Con
- Redundant duplication, waste of space
- Performance can be slow, boot times can be long
- Reproducing on another computer / server is possible but may still be tricky

## Containers vs Virtual Machines

Docker Containers
- Low impact on OS, very fast, minimal disk space usage
- Sharing, re-building and distribution is easy
- Encapsulate apps/ environments instead of "whole machines"

Virtual Machines
- Bigger impact on OS, slower, higher disk space usage
- Sharing, re-building and distribution can be challenging
- Encapsulate "whole machines" instead of just apps/ environments

### Docker Tools & Building Blocks

1. Docker Engine
2. Docker Desktop (incl. Daemon & CLI)
3. Docker Hub
4. Docker Compose

### Getting Our Hands Dirty!

folder structure
```
docker-complete
\_ .gitignore
\_ app.mjs
\_ Dockerfile
\_ helpers.mjs
\_ package.json
```

Dockerfile
```docker
FROM node:14

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json .

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD [ "node", "app.mjs" ]
```

Project init
```
## npm init
$ cd docker-complete
$ npm init
$ npm install express
$ npm install

## run test
$ node app.mjs # localhost:3000
```

Docker build and run

```
## docker build
$ docker build .

## docker run
$ docker run
docker run -p 3000:3000 9577bce378a3651b4ca204949e1f9f2b55c72a5eb25f978ab270e4f8e7cd5d19

Docker stop

```
# new terminal
$ docker ps # name check
$ docker stop [name]
