# What is Flutter?
A "tool" that allows you to build native cross-platform (iOS, Android) apps with one programming language and codebase.

##### A SDK (Software Development Kit)
- Tools to compile your code to native machine code + develop with ease

##### A Framework/ Widget Library
- Re-usable UI building blocks (= widgets), utility functions, packages


### What is Dart?
Focused on frontend (mobile apps, web) user interface (UI) development

### Flutter Architecture
- UI as Code: Build a **Widget Tree**
- Embrace **Platform Differences**
- **One** Codebases
- Flutter does NOT use platform primitives
- Custom implementation ("Flutter directly controls every pixel which drawn")
- greater control, less platform-limitations/ no "translation loss"
